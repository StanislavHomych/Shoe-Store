## After installing all packages you also need to install packages for DB, because i have used JSON-Server as emulation of  DB for this project. 
## They are located in "ShoesAppDB" directory, you need to start server, in cmd type this command: 
# `npm run serve-json` 
## Then start React project. 
### You can use this User name and password (User Name:"Admin", password: "Admin1111") if you don't want to make registration or smth went wrong. 
## Thank you for atention.
